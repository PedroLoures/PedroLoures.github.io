### Overview
Recifituro was my first game project. When I got into college on Brazil, we had to make an educational game in the first semester with an open theme choice. We decided to go with Puzzle Adventure, and made this game. I was in charge of Game Design, Level Design, Programming and Sound Effects.

### Challenges
Screenshot system in the Game Maker - doesn't work in the newer version. They took away the compatibility of functions in the newer versions of GM -, inventory system taking advantage on the fact that GM never needed to declare a concrete type in a variable - thanks to that, using a matrix, I could minimize effort and time, get a better performance out of it, with fewer lines of code. What this means is that I could put, just as I would in a json, all the data regardless of the content type directly into just one matrix variable. Another great thing GM teaches well is to use inheritance. Every button in this game was made through it, just changing text and action values.
