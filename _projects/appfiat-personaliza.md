### Overview
It allowed the client to create his own sticker, by choosing colors and forms, visualize it in a 3D simulation where it would apply the sticker on the vehicle to see how it would look like and afterwards, buy the sticker on a e-commerce platform.
For this project we used a touchscreen PC and was a promotional event by Fiat on a selling stand on _Minas Tênis Clube_ - _Belo Horizonte_."

### How it works
1. Enter your name by clicking on "Nome", not in the blank space, and type it in.
2. Your email
3. Birth year - it will be hidden from view, because it's very common for older women, at least in Brazil, to feel uncomfortable with answering that question.
4. Now, you can choose the car settings, if you want a already completed design or do one yourself, choose shapes, and so on. You can also rotate the camera.

### Challenges
We had 10 days to make this project, it was mostly a pitch from D2R to Fiat. As an intern an with only a year and a half working with Unity, I barely had the knowledge to do it, so I had to crunch and figuring out if I could find a plugin to help me with the decal system since the math for it was not that easy to understand (deform a plane to fit a mesh).

Since this project was for a company that owns the code, I cannot showcase.
