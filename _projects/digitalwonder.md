### Overview
The Digital Wonderland was the first 3d game and second game I ever made. This game was set in a Digital World that was affected by a virus and a student from the same school they were on got trapped inside of it a few months prior and became urban legend on the school. In that world, they have special powers and enhanced abilities, and the virus took control of the poor first student that got inside, making her use those powers to cause chaos on the world, and when they try the urban legend, the group gets sucked into this world. The guide and companion of this adventure is the prince and princess of the realm, the _Squiddy_! He/She has two faces, and a crown with a jewel (red or blue), so you can see which one you are talking with. The game was supposed to have a character inspired in each of the girls, but due to problems with one member leaving the program on the second semester of development, two characters were cut short.
