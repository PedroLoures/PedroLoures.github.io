### Overview
This app was for a Computer Science student. I was invited by one of my teachers to aid her in this project, where Raphaela wanted to make an educational programming game and needed help. She only had less than 6 months left and had not even started the concept. During our talks, I realized she didn't know where to begin, so, I asked her about what she liked. She told me about greek mythology, so, to make it more enjoyable for her to work with, and also make her even more proud of it, I wrote every level based on greek mythology stories. Before each part, the game will tell a tale with a piece of the mythology, and propose to you the challenge of make it happen. In the game itself, the person will have to program in LUA to move on.


### Challenges
Get a language that can be compiled from within C# on Unity back then. First thing I remembered was about games having mods and that they usually were in Lua. That made my search be concluded very easily.

The idea is basically that we kinda know what we expect and anything that doesnt compute the output we expect is going to either see a custom message or an error message from the compiler.
