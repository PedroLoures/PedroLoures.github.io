### Overview
During my studies after graduating, I decided to look at maze generating algorithms but in 3D. I found some interesting styles, and I enjoyed one in particular, and from a lot of reading, I started this project, following the base line I saw on my readings, but with some modifications because it doesn't check any overlays. This is the second test, because I started checking the collisions and special rooms. It is currently shelved.
