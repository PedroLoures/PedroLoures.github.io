### Overview
This was a project made for a Centennial project during my third term in December 2020.
We had two weeks to create a project that showed what was taught during the term.
We chose doing a character customization with a twist. Since we were also allowed to do a tower defense, we wanted to make a tower customization for one tower defense.
