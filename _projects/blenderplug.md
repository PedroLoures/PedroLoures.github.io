### Overview
A simple plugin made to help the animator use less clicks when changing the textures of the facial expressions of the characters. The way it works is that the facial files follow specific naming conventions that so does the face objects. Like CharacterName_LeftEye would look for the folder in the root of the .blender file named CharacterName and inside would look for the LeftEye folder. Everything in there would be loaded under Facial Expressions to be chosen. There also is an experimental button to add a keyframe to the specific moment in time. This saves a lot of time for the animations and is the reason I liked and wanted to do it. I love seeing my projects being helpful, either for entertainment or not.

### Challenges
Learn and do a plugin fast enough to be useful, work well in the pipeline, but not waste time since this was a side project for the company and not actual part of the job.
