### Overview
"This app was developed to a presentation room of Vale do Rio Doce in the Edifício Hélio Ferraz, inside Porto de Tubarão, and in partnership with Zor Design.

The system uses a desktop app that distributes the app to three bordless screens where the can be visualized images, videos and informations about Porto de Tubarão, and is controlled by another app on the iPad." - http://www.d2rstudios.com/category/newmedia/

This project is from 2012 and remade in 2019 to use in a PC and Android with a better Networking system.

### 2012 Version
The 2012 version was made by two people. I was an intern at D2R and was in charge of the desktop version. Back then, Unity had no 2D so I had to make my own code to create the sprite system. I was a beginner in Unity so I did not know much of Coroutines back then, but, used a speed variable together with Update to make it work.

The communication between Mac and iPad was made by the other developer, and was a database communication.

### 2015 Version
2015 had a few changes made to the project, a few new files and a few expansions made on the iPad to visually allow more images per file - there was no pagination system on it.

The PC version always had the Resources folder and as long as the images are named accordingly, there is not need to change level design or code. It's pretty much generate build after adding them to the project.

### 2019 Version
The 2019 version had the biggest change and had only one month to make it happen. I remade the iPad version from scratch to the new and improved way Unity behaves with mobile and made changes to the PC for an actual networking system and leaving _OnGUI_ behind in this project.

The project went from prior to Unity Hub to 2018.4 version.
