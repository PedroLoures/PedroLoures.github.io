This makes it easier to track, in average, how the place is doing. You can also see them individually. (graphs.png image)</p> <p>With their knowledge, they will read the graphs, and the issues that are happening and try to find solutions for them. All issues in this game - that are around 76 right now, but has an admin system for the company to add more - are read from a json that we pick up from the web admin system. They were written by a consultant that goes around Brazil aiding in solving car dealers problems when their manager can’t, so it’s with things she saw everywhere that she put up this issues.</p> <p>Knowing the issue and checking the graphs helps the manager to pinpoint which part of the process in car dealing that the issue must be in, and who probably is involved, so they then will go after checking the NPCs and click them, and diagnose the issue - which means they will talk to them about what’s going on to see if they can figure out who needs a bit of talking to get better. If you choose the right speech balloons, you will get influence - because the quality manager doesn’t command, he can just suggest solutions to people, it’s up to them to take it, so every action you do, consumes time, but the more influence you have, the faster you convince someone to do it. If you poorly choose the balloons, you will lose influence instead.</p> <p>When you think you know what is the solution, and who it is related to, you choose the grey options in the npc if you are correct, you will get a mission complete at the top. If it’s also the last issue on that day, or if you run out of time that day, the next starts. You keep the unfinished issues from the prior day, and may receive knew ones, depending on how far on the game you are. All issues have a count of difficulty between 1 and 4, and it scales between seven days between fibonnaci - with possibility to custom it off - values. So, in the 7 day you can have at most 13 difficulty 1 issues, or a mix between the difficulty levels.</p> </details> <h3 id="images">Images</h3> <p><a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#mainModal"><img src="img/appfiat-treinamento/base.png" alt="base" /></a> <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#mainModal"><img src="img/appfiat-treinamento/dayend.png" alt="dayend" /></a> <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#mainModal"><img src="img/appfiat-treinamento/diagnose.png" alt="diagnose" /></a> <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#mainModal"><img src="img/appfiat-treinamento/graphs.png" alt="graphs" /></a> <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#mainModal"><img src="img/appfiat-treinamento/issues.png" alt="issues" /></a> <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#mainModal"><img src="img/appfiat-treinamento/movearound.png" alt="movearound" /></a> <a data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#mainModal"><img src="img/appfiat-treinamento/npcs.png" alt="npcs" /></a></p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="card" data-id="/projects_programming/blenderplug"> <div class="card__container card__container--closed" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="A Python plugin to help make facial animation easier"> <svg class="card__image" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" viewBox="0 0 1920 1080" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid slice"> <defs> <clipPath id="/projects_programming/blenderplug-clip-path"> <polygon class="clip" points="0,1080 0,0 1920,0 1920,1080"></polygon> </clipPath> </defs> <image clip-path="url(#/projects_programming/blenderplug-clip-path)" width="1920" height="1080" xlink:href="/img/blenderplug/Front.png"></image> </svg> <div class="card__content"> <div class="card__copy"> <div class="card__caption"> <h2 class="card__title">Blender Plugin</h2> </div> <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3> <p>A simple plugin made to help the animator use less clicks when changing the textures of the facial expressions of the characters.</p> <h3 id="how-it-helps">How it helps</h3> <p>It saves a lot of time for the animators.

I was an intern at D2R and was in charge of the desktop version. Back then, Unity had no 2D so I had to make my own code to create the sprite system. I was a beginner in Unity so I did not know much of Coroutines back then, but, used a speed variable together with Update to make it work.</p> <p>The communication between Mac and iPad was made by the other developer, and was a database communication.</p> <h3 id="version-1">2015 Version</h3> <p>2015 had a few changes made to the project, a few new files and a few expansions made on the iPad to visually allow more images per file - there was no pagination system on it.</p> <p>The PC version always had the Resources folder and as long as the images are named accordingly, there is not need to change level design or code. It’s pretty much generate build after adding them to the project.</p> <h3 id="version-2">2019 Version</h3> <p>The 2019 version had the biggest change and had only one month to make it happen. I remade the iPad version from scratch to the new and improved way Unity behaves with mobile and made changes to the PC for an actual networking system and leaving <em>OnGUI</em> behind in this project.</p> <p>The project went from prior to Unity Hub to 2018.4 version.</p> </details> <h3 id="video">Video</h3> <div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;margin-bottom:1em;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/445223753" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div> <script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script> <div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"> <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/duamZdhYHSY" frameborder="0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="card" data-id="/projects_programming/appfiat-personaliza"> <div class="card__container card__container--closed" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="Personalization of vehicles by allowing the creation of exclusives stickers"> <svg class="card__image" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" viewBox="0 0 1920 1080" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid slice"> <defs> <clipPath id="/projects_programming/appfiat-personaliza-clip-path"> <polygon class="clip" points="0,1080 0,0 1920,0 1920,1080"></polygon> </clipPath> </defs> <image clip-path="url(#/projects_programming/appfiat-personaliza-clip-path)" width="1920" height="1080" xlink:href="/img/appfiat-personaliza/Front.png"></image> </svg> <div class="card__content"> <div class="card__copy"> <div class="card__caption"> <h2 class="card__title">App Fiat - Personalização Fiat</h2> </div> <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3> <p>It allowed the client to create his own sticker, by choosing colors and forms, visualize it in a 3D simulation where it would apply the sticker on the vehicle to see how it would look like and afterwards, buy the sticker on a e-commerce platform.

I was invited by one of my teachers to aid her in this project, where Raphaela wanted to make an educational programming game and needed help. She only had less than 6 months left and had not even started the concept. During our talks, I realized she didn’t know where to begin, so, I asked her about what she liked. She told me about greek mythology, so, to make it more enjoyable for her to work with, and also make her even more proud of it, I wrote every level based on greek mythology stories. Before each part, the game will tell a tale with a piece of the mythology, and propose to you the challenge of make it happen. In the game itself, the person will have to program in LUA to move on.</p> <h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3> <p>Get a language that can be compiled from within C# on Unity back then.
